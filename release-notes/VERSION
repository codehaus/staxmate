Version: 1.0.0

Release date: xx-Apr-2007

Description:
  First official release of StaxMate. Contains baseline functionality
  and is designed to work with Stax2 extensions, version 2.0 (which
  is what Woodstox 3.x ships with).

Problems fixed:

  * [STAXMATE-1]: Cursor synchronization did not work as expected 
    when reading text nodes.
  * Handling of sub-tree skipping when START_ELEMENT were filtered out
    was not working correctly (either with hierarchic or flat cursors)

New functionality:

  * Added ElementFilter, for only accessing elements with specified
    name

== History: ==

0.9.1: [12-Sep-2006]

  * Nested cursor synchronization problems fixed, unit tests added
    [contributed by Ed G, David B]

0.9: [11-Aug-2006]

  New functionality:

  * Full writer-side functionality included

  Rewrite:

  * Converted StaxMate to JDK 1.5: now uses Enums as return values, which
    is nice as Enums can have properties.
  * Renamed 'iterators' to 'cursors' (input side change); renamed packages
    to have more meaningful names.
