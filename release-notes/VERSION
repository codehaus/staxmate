Version: 0.9.2

Release date: 12-Sep-2006

Description:
  Fixed an important problem, cleaned up some comments, and wanted
  to release current state to be used for some sample code.

  Problems fixed:

  * Handling of sub-tree skipping when START_ELEMENT were filtered out
    was not working correctly (either with hierarchic or flat cursors)

  New functionality:

  * Added ElementFilter, for only accessing elements with specified
    name
  * Added unit tests for filters

== History: ==

    [contributed by Ed G, David B]

0.9: [11-Aug-2006]

  New functionality:

  * Full writer-side functionality included

  Rewrite:

  * Converted StaxMate to JDK 1.5: now uses Enums as return values, which
    is nice as Enums can have properties.
  * Renamed 'iterators' to 'cursors' (input side change); renamed packages
    to have more meaningful names.
