Version: 1.2.0

Release date: 01-Aug-2008

Description:
  Maintenance release focused on improved interoperability by verifying
  support for Stax implementations other than Woodstox.

Problems fixed:
  * [STAXMATE-6]: Verify that StaxMate works well on Sun Sjsxp (default
    Stax impl of JDK 6). One fix to Stax2 ref. impl (from Woodstox);
    one workaround to Sjsxp bug (#63).
  * [STAXMATE-11]: Verify that StaxMate works well on Aalto XML processor

== History: ==

1.1.0: [13-Nov-2007]

New functionality:
  * [STAXMATE-3]: Added SMInputCursor.hasName() methods.

Improvements:

  * [STAXMATE-4]: Rewrite cursor synchronization (sub-tree skipping) using
    depth information given by underlying Stax2 stream reader, instead of
    each cursor keeping local nesting counts.

1.0.0: [02-May-2007]

  Problems fixed:

  * [STAXMATE-1]: Cursor synchronization did not work as expected 
    when reading text nodes.
  * Handling of sub-tree skipping when START_ELEMENT were filtered out
    was not working correctly (either with hierarchic or flat cursors)

  New functionality:

  * Added ElementFilter, for only accessing elements with specified
    name

0.9.1: [12-Sep-2006]

  Problems fixed:

  * Nested cursor synchronization problems fixed, unit tests added

0.9: [11-Aug-2006]

  New functionality:

  * Full writer-side functionality included

  Rewrite:

  * Converted StaxMate to JDK 1.5: now uses Enums as return values, which
    is nice as Enums can have properties.
  * Renamed 'iterators' to 'cursors' (input side change); renamed packages
    to have more meaningful names.
